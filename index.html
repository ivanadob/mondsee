            <p id="d2e50"> The project's aim is to gain new insights at the scribal activities at the Benedictine
               monastery of Mondsee during the Early and High Middle Ages. The monastery was an important
               local centre for book production in Upper Austria already shortly after its foundation
               in 748. Building upon the seminal works by B. Bischoff, K. Holter and C. Pfaff the
               present study will conduct 
               
               <ul id="d2e52">
                  
                  <li id="d2e54">a detailed analysis of the codicological and palaeographical features presented in
                     the manuscripts combining classical and digital methods;</li>
                  
                  <li id="d2e57">scientific analysis of the writing materials.</li>
                  </ul>
               The interdisciplinary methods will provide the means to reexamine the material and
               detect new characteristics of the Mondsee book production. This will, on the one hand,
               allow for written documents with till now uncertain origin to be recognised as products
               of the Mondsee scriptorium; on the other hand, it will be possible to examine the
               development of the written culture in a longue duree, accounting for the influences
               of foreign monastic centres both in terms of writing materials as well as of transmission
               of texts.</p>
            
            <p id="d2e62">This project is planned as a case study within the major project <a href="https://www.ditah.at/projects/m3r.html">Multimodale Manuskriptrepräsentationen (M3R)</a>. All data - both scholarly descriptions and scientific data - collected within the
               project will be stored and represented within the newly designed platform.</p>
            
            <p id="d2e68"> In the meantime this website gives access to the scholarly <a href="https://ivanadob.github.io/mondsee/index-mss.html">descriptions</a> of the pre-12th-century Mondsee manuscripts. This is a work-in-progress; we are constantly
               working on improving and enhancing the information provided. </p>

            <h2 id="d2e79">Manuscripts</h2>
            
            <p id="d2e81"> The manuscript descriptions are encoded using the guidelines of the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>, which
               is an XML standard widely adopted in the digital humanities for the
               representation of texts. </p>
            
            <p id="d2e87"> To validate the mark-up we used the TEI P5 schema for <a href="http://www.europeanaregia.eu/">Europeana Regia</a> (ER). The
               practices from the <a href="http://www.hab.de/">Herzog August library
                  Wolfenbüttel</a> were taken as an example for structuring the manuscript
               descriptions. People, places are texts (works within manuscripts) are tagged as
               such and gathered in indices together with additional information as well as
               links to further resources. The XML files are also available for download. </p>
            
            <p id="d2e96"> With the growing number of manuscript description being added to the database we
               are further working on different possibilities to search, filter and analyse the
               data. Apart from full text search we plan to integrate faceted search to filter
               the manuscripts according to certain criteria (shelfmark, origin place / time,
               texts etc.) and possibly to combine different criteria. </p>
